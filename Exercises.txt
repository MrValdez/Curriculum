1. Data Types
    a = 1
    b = 2
    print(a + b)


2. Exercise. Introduce print and input functions

    print ("Hello. What is your name?")
    name = input()
    print ("You are " + name)

3. Exercise. Code organization: one line - one instruction

    print ("Hello. What is your name?")
    name = input()
    message = "You are " + name
    print(message)

4. Introduce operators

   Math operators: + - / *
    
    Exercise.
    
    print ("Type your first name.")
    first_name = input()
    print ("Type your last name.")
    last_name = input()
    print ("Your full name is " + first_name + " " + last_name)
    
    Exercise.
    print ("Your full name is {} {}".format(first_name, last_name))
    
    Exercise. clean code. easier to read if one instruction per line.
    message = "Your full name is {} {}".format(first_name, last_name)
    print (message)
    

5. Exercise. 
    print ("Type a number:")
    number1 = input()
    print ("Type another number:")
    number2 = input()
    total = number1 + number2
    print ("Total is " + total)
    
   Ask what happened. Explain that input() returns string
   
  String operator: +
   
   Exercise.
    print ("Type a number:")
    number1 = input()
    number1 = int(number1)
    print ("Type another number:")
    number2 = int(input())
    total = number1 + number2
    print ("Total is " + total)

   Explain that both forms are valid.
   There will still be a bug. Introduce str.
    print ("Total is " + str(total))
   
   Review data types.


6. Exercise. Introduce optional parameters
    age = input("How old are you? ")
    print ("You are {} years old".format(age))



7. Boolean. Introduce Boolean.

    Exercise.

    age = input("How old are you? ")
    age = int(age)

    if age >= 18:
        print ("You can vote")

    Introduce if statements.
    Introduce conditional operators: > < >= <= == !=
    
    Exercise. Introduce else.
    
    else:
        print ("You may not vote")

    Exercise. Introduce elif.

    elif age <= 0:
        print ("Invalid age")


8. Code block. 4 spaces. { } in other langauges

    age = input("How old are you? ")
    age = int(age)

    if age >= 18:      
        print ("You can vote")
        print ("Vote right")
    elif age >= 13 and age <= 17:
        print ("Wait a bit")
    else:              
        print ("You may not vote")


9. Exercise. Introduce lists

fruits = ["Apple", "Grapes", "Guyabano", "Durian"]
print (fruits[1])       # Grapes
print (fruits[0])       # Apple
i = 3
print (fruits[i])       # Durian

# print (fruits[4])     # IndexError
print (fruits[-1])      # Durian
print (fruits[-3])      # Grapes
# print (fruits[-5])    # IndexError

Introduce for-loops.

# for loop
# C:    for (<init>; <cond>; <move the iteration>)
# Java: for (<init>; <cond>; <move the iteration>)

# for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
for i in range(4):
    print (fruits[i])

print ("---")

#"Apple", "Grapes", "Guyabano", "Durian"
#  0,        1,       2,           3

# for (int i = 1; i < 4; i+=2)
for i in range(1, 4, 2):
    print (fruits[i])

print ("---")

# foreach
for fruit in fruits:
    print (fruit)
    
10. Introduce String functions

# string functions
movie = "Titanic"

print(movie.upper())
print(movie.lower())
print(movie.swapcase())

movie = "saan ka man naroon"
print(movie.title())

11. Introduce in operator.

colors = ["Red", "Purple", "Pink", "Black", "Blue"]

# boolean operator
# <element> in <list>

print("red" in colors)          # False
print("Red" not in colors)      # False
print("red".title() in colors)  # True


12. Introduce turtle/logo programming

# logo turtle
# logo programming

import turtle

turtle.forward(100)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.penup()
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.pendown()
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(100)

turtle.exitonclick()


Quiz. Make a turtle program drawing a letter. If a letter has already been drawn, you cannot draw that letter.


13. Introduce random

import random

names = ["Van", "Junjun", "Kevin", "Jerick", "Matthew"]
random.shuffle(names)
print(names)

lucky = random.choice(names)

print("Today's lucky person is " + lucky)


14. Introduce multi-line string


15. Introduce list slicing.


16. Introduce list functions: append, remove, reverse

names = ["Van", "Junjun", "Kevin", "Jerick", "Matthew"]
names.append("John")
names.remove("Van")

print(names[0])   # Junjun
print(names[4])   # John

names.append("Buttercup")
print(len(names))   # 6

#names.remove("Van") # ValueError
print(len(names))   # 6

names[3] = "Van"
names.reverse()
print(names)        # [Buttercup, John, Van, Jerick, Kevin, Junjun]



17. Introduce string functions, count, split, join.



18. Introduce file open()

Introduce with statement

19. Introduce OOP
